# My Portfolio Repository (Source)
 In this repository, I am storing the codes for my Portfolio, since I am using submodules.

### Main repository link: https://github.com/DouglasMedeiros1/My_Portifolio

## Organization

I am organizing my repository based on my previous knowledge, based on my college classes related to Devops and Martin Fowler's articles (Link: https://www.martinfowler.com).

### Therefore, I am using the branches as follows:

#### Main:
I store stable versions of the system, in other words, they are the versions that the system has and the last step of the process

#### Development:
Main branch from where I create new branches and where I merge each branch

#### Branches (Feat | Feature-Name):
In branches with a name similar to the model: Feat | Feature Name, each branch is a feature that is added to the system, following the naming pattern.

In the "Feat" space, there are a few alternatives:
- Add: When something new is added
- Fix: When something already developed is changed
- Del: When something is removed from the system
- Upd: When something is added to a feature that has already been created

### Commit Pattern

All commits below must follow the model: feat | Feature-Name

### Developed using Typescript and React
